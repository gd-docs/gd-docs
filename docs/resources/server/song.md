# Client & Server Song Resource

## Song

Songs in Geometry Dash are supplied through a partnership with a website called [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio). To be used in community made levels, a song must pass **3** requirements

- The Song must be scouted by another artist from newgrounds
- The Song must be whitelisted either by Robtop or an Elder Moderator
- The artist must enable external API use in their song settings

The songs can be downloaded and used via a private API that only RobTop has access to

A typical song server response is structured with a `key~|~value~|~key~|~value` pairing and is then split with a `:`

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Song Example**
```md
1~|~803223~|~2~|~Xtrullor - Arcana~|~3~|~2159~|~4~|~Xtrullor~|~5~|~8.81~|~6~|~~|~10~|~https%3A%2F%2Faudio.ngfiles.com%2F803000%2F803223_Xtrullor---Arcana.mp3%3Ff1524940372~|~7~|~UCejLri1RVC7kj8ZVNX2a53g      
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below

The IDs for Music Library songs start at 10,000,000

#### **Trivia**
- The savefile song structure uses the exact same keys as the server response
- The user-friendly URL to open with the "Download Soundtrack" button is determined as follows:
	- if `downloadSoundtrackOverride` has value, use it
	- else if it's an NCS song, use `link`
	- else if `videoID` has value, use `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={videoID}`
	- else use `https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/{id}`
